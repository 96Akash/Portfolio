                <h3>Stack Overflow Clone</h3>
                <p>In this project, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js to build a responsive website.
                    The main goals and outcomes included:<br>

                     Focused on developing a user-friendly interface, which deepened my understanding
                    of front-end development.<br>

                     Enhanced my skills in creating engaging and interactive user interfaces through my 
                    first major project.<br>

                    Implemented responsive design principles to ensure the website was accessible and visually appealing across various devices
                     and screen sizes.  Improved my ability to debug code and optimize performance, resulting in a smoother user experience.</p>

                <h3>Weather Application</h3>
                <p>This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. It was specifically
                    designed as a learning exercise to deepen my understanding of React.js.<br>

                    Learned how to fetch data from external APIs and use it to create dynamic user
                    interfaces.<br>

                    Gained experience in managing state and props in React to build modular and
                    scalable components.<br>

                    Improved skills in front-end development and responsive design.
